/* Create 2 JavaScript files. 
* The first one will export a function called getFlag
* which will receive an argument of type String.
* This function should look inside the array process.argv for the flag and return the value of the flag
* 
* The second will import the function and pass the desired flag.
* 
* We will run the second file in the terminal passing the e-greeting flags-name
* to have the person's greeting and name printed on the terminal. */
